# LowFieldMRI-Distortion-Correction
This is for Ultra-Low-field MRI distortion correction. 

ULF-MRI (<0.1T) is gaining academical and industrial interests these days. ULF-MRI has emerged as a promising alternative with several advantages, such as low cost, improved accessibility, enhanced safety, etc. ULF-MRI usually adopt permanant magnet design. B0 homogeneity is critical for achieving acceptable spatial resolution and geometric accuracy. B0 inhomogeneity is the main source of image distortion in ULF-MRI. 

In this repositority, I shared how to use TOPUP and TORTOISE/DR BUDDI which are used for EPI distortion correction in high-field for ULF-MRI distortion correction.
